I got the responses to work in a way where you type in anything -- or part of anything and it will print a list of matches.  You can see the code in the play methods in the kyle-work branch.

I think the next thing to do with the code that would be cool is someway to compensate for spelling errors and the like.  As it stands now, the program will suggest things, but only if the array explicitly includes the user's input.  So some further suggestive ability in the program would be neat.
